"# LoSST-old-" 

This is an old respository of some code from my MS thesis project. It contains the LoSST algorithm in a matlab file labeled OSLM, and an old version of the Bayes Net Toolbox that I modified for use with LoSST.

Note that the code was written on a now out of date version of matlab, and may not run as written on modern versions. Similarly, it was made to run with the modified version of BNT that is included in this repository, and may not function on the modern version of BNT.

To learn more about LoSST, see my paper with David Danks:
